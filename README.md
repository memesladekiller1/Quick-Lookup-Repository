# Quick-Look Description / Usage / Customization
The AutoHotkey v2 or .exe script provides you with a quick, private knowledge retrieval system that takes a single directory of text documents, and allows for an instantly searchable, private database. The core function of this script is to create a weighted keyword-matching algorithm that scans your text for structured blocks based on defined start and stop markers (--start, --end) to locate and extract highly relevant information related to your query. The "Stealth Mode" (Ctrl+P) provides a borderless, minimal input bar right at your cursor enabling you to copy data from an undetectable manner, and "Visual Mode" (Shift+L) provides a window that can always be on top of other open windows, and that scrolls, for reviewing long-form notes. The application works completely independently of the internet by operating in your Windows Downloads folder directory, providing you complete privacy, and allows you to access the information that you need, within almost no time at all. Therefore, this application is suitable for students and professionals alike who need to pull complex paragraphs or snippets of data into their workflow, without the distraction of having to switch windows or manually search through their files. In short, this application allows you to bridge the gap between taking static notes, and actively being productive by placing your entire library of "Quick-Lookup-Repository" (name of the file where text should be) behind only two easily customized, hot keys.

When considering customising the script (Quick-Look-Up) Repository there is a thin line between personalising it and making the system unstable. Although the script was developed with flexibility in mind, you should always treat manual edits as trial and error in order to prevent disrupting the core logic of the retrieval function.
